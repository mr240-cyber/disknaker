// Bootstrap Laravel (since we are running from CLI/artisan context usually requires creating a command or route, 
// but if we use `php artisan Tinker` logic or a route it's easier. 
// I'll create a standalone script that requires loading the app, but simpler to just make a temporary route or console command?
// Actually, `php artisan tinker` is hard to automate output reading.
// I will create a temporary route in web.php that I can call via curl or just read via tool if run via php? 
// No, running `php public/index.php` is hard.
// Best way: Create a custom artisan command or a simple script that bootstraps laravel.
// Or effectively, I can just use a route and `read_url_content` if I had a server running? I don't control the server.
// I can write a script that I run with `php` but I need to include `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`.

// Simpler approach: Create a temporary route `/debug-db` in `web.php` that returns the JSON data, 
// but I cannot "hit" it from here easily without `curl` to localhost if the user has the server running.
// The user has the server running? "User says: di databases sudah ada data masuk".
// I don't have access to the running server.
// I have `read_url_content` but I don't know the port.

// Alternative: Write a script that manually connects to DB using credentials from `.env`.
// I'll read `.env` first to get credentials.
